### Summary

Basic project for learning purposes.

Will be adding new stuff, trying out things and see how everything works out.

 - One application named 'hello' with a view returning a "Hello World!" string.
 - One application named 'users' with integrated django views for a basic User model.

### How to run:

(Will be adding requisites instructions)

- Run on a terminal
  `python manage.py runserver`
